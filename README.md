# EDMCalendar

Creates an EDM calendar (only runs locally at the moment) in your browser by parsing BandsInTown for shows! You can specify a location and artists in "EDMCal/spiders/bandsInTown_spider.py". Just run "sh run.sh" to start the calendar using a localhost.

Future goals (when I have time):
1. Run code on a server
2. Allow for easy parameter input / customization (location, artists)
3. Recommend shows based on artist input (personalization with ML)
4. Improve the UI
