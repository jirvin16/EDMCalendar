# Music Calendar

Creates a music calendar (only runs locally at the moment) in your browser by parsing BandsInTown for shows! You can specify a location and artists in "EDMCal/spiders/bandsInTown_spider.py". Just run "sh run.sh" to start the calendar using a localhost. 

This is a project I began a long time ago and have not touched in a while, but I plan to update it and make it much easier to use within the year :D

## Libraries
Uses Scrapy (http://scrapy.org/) and FullCalendar (http://fullcalendar.io/)

## Future goals (when I have time):

1. Run code on a server
2. Allow for easy parameter input / customization (location, artists)
3. Recommend shows based on artist input (personalization with ML)
4. Improve the UI
